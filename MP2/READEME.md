# Assignment 2: Multi-Layer Neural Networks

In this assignment you will implement multi-layer neural networks on the CIFAR-10 image classification dataset, which was used in Assignment 1 as well. 
The goal of this assignment is to help you understand the fundamentals of neural networks and backpropagation. 
Specifically, you will write your own forward and backward pass and train two- and three-layer networks with SGD and Adam optimizers. 
You will also get experience with hyperparameter tuning and using proper train/test/validation data splits. 
The format of this assignment is inspired by the Stanford CS231n assignments, and we have borrowed some of their data loading and instructions.

I implemented the following classifiers (in their respective files):

1. 2 Layer SGD
2. 3 Layer SGD
3. 2 Layer Adam
4. 3 Layer Adam
